# EchoSphere Delay VST - Development Phases

## Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
**Focus**: Core Delay Engine - Basic Functionality
* Basic mono delay with single delay line
* Delay time control (ms and sync to tempo with basic subdivisions)
* Feedback control (0-100%)
* Simple wet/dry mix
* Basic UI with essential controls only
* Cross-platform compatibility (VST3/AU)
* Robust audio processing with no artifacts

## Phase 2: Stereo and Tone Shaping
**Focus**: Expanding core delay functionality and adding tone coloration
* Upgrade to full stereo capabilities
  * Linked stereo mode
  * Ping-pong delay mode
* In-loop tone shaping
  * Low-pass filter
  * High-pass filter
* Improved sync options (dotted and triplet notes)
* Tap tempo functionality
* Improved UI with proper parameter displays

## Phase 3: Modulation and Character
**Focus**: Adding motion and analog character
* LFO system implementation
  * Multiple waveforms (sine, triangle, square, saw, random)
  * Rate control (free and synced)
  * Modulation depth
* Basic modulation routing to:
  * Delay time
  * Filter frequency
* Saturation/warmth control for analog-style character
* Dual/independent delay mode (separate L/R controls)
* Enhanced visual feedback for modulation
* Preset system foundation

## Phase 4: Complete UI and Preset Management
**Focus**: Polishing user experience
* Full preset management system
  * Save/load functionality
  * Factory presets organized by category
  * User presets
* A/B comparison functionality
* Comprehensive visual feedback
  * Input/output metering
  * LFO visualization
  * Filter response visualization
* Resizable interface
* Complete parameter automation support
* Tooltips and help system
* Refinement of all UI elements for consistency

## Phase 5: Advanced Features
**Focus**: Adding creative expansion features
* Additional modulation routing to:
  * Pan
  * Amplitude
* Enhanced modulation capabilities
* Ducking functionality
* Freeze/Hold feature
* Diffusion/smear control
* Reverse delay option
* CPU optimization pass
* Extended factory preset library
* Final polish and bug fixes

## Phase 6: Finalization and Release
**Focus**: Production readiness
* Final QA testing across all platforms and DAWs
* User documentation and manual
* Marketing materials
* Installer finalization
* Licensing/activation system implementation
* Public beta testing
* Performance optimization
* Release version 1.0

## Future Considerations (Post v1.0)
* Additional modulation sources (envelope follower)
* More filter types (band-pass, notch, comb)
* Grain/pitch shifting options
* Mid/side processing
* Integrated reverb module
* Advanced routing options
