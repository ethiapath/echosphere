**1. Introduction**

EchoSphere is a versatile and high-fidelity stereo delay VST/AU/AAX plugin designed for music producers, mixing engineers, and sound designers. It aims to provide classic delay functionalities (digital, tape emulation hints) alongside flexible modulation options and an intuitive user interface, enabling users to create a wide range of echo, spatial, and rhythmic effects.

**2. Goals & Objectives**

* Provide a professional-grade, sonically pleasing delay effect suitable for various musical genres and sound design tasks.
* Offer both classic and creative delay capabilities through flexible routing and modulation.
* Ensure an intuitive, easy-to-use interface that provides clear visual feedback.
* Optimize for low CPU usage without compromising audio quality.
* Maintain stability and compatibility across major DAWs and operating systems.
* Become a go-to delay plugin for users seeking both standard and modulated echo effects.

**3. Target Audience**

* **Music Producers:** Working in various genres (Electronic, Pop, Rock, Hip Hop, Ambient, etc.) needing bread-and-butter delays as well as creative rhythmic effects.
* **Mixing Engineers:** Requiring precise, clean delays for adding space and depth, or characterful delays for specific sonic textures.
* **Sound Designers:** Creating atmospheric effects, rhythmic textures, and unique sonic movements for games, film, and music.
* **Musicians/Hobbyists:** Looking for an affordable, high-quality, and easy-to-use delay plugin.

**4. Features**

**4.1 Core Delay Engine**

* **Delay Time:**
    * **Sync Mode:** Synchronize delay time to host DAW tempo.
        * Subdivisions: Dotted notes (e.g., 1/4d, 1/8d), Triplet notes (e.g., 1/4t, 1/8t, 1/16t), Standard notes (e.g., 1/1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64).
        * Clear visual display of the selected subdivision.
    * **Free Mode:** Manually set delay time in milliseconds (e.g., 1 ms to 5000 ms).
        * Clear numerical display.
        * Option for coarse and fine adjustment.
    * **Tap Tempo:** Button to manually tap in the desired tempo/delay time.
* **Feedback:**
    * Control the amount of delayed signal fed back into the input (0% to 110%).
    * Values above 100% allow for controlled self-oscillation.
* **Mix Control:**
    * Wet/Dry Mix knob (0% to 100%) for parallel processing.
    * Optional: Separate Output Level controls for Wet and Dry signals.
* **Stereo Modes:**
    * **Linked Stereo:** Left and Right channels share the same settings.
    * **Ping-Pong:** Delay alternates between Left and Right channels.
    * **Dual / Independent:** Separate Delay Time and Feedback controls for Left and Right channels. Offset controls can link/unlink parameters نسبياً.

**4.2 Tone Shaping (Within Feedback Loop)**

* **Filters:**
    * **Low-Pass Filter (LPF):** Sweepable frequency control (e.g., 20 Hz to 20 kHz). Affects only the delayed signal within the feedback loop, darkening repeats over time.
    * **High-Pass Filter (HPF):** Sweepable frequency control (e.g., 20 Hz to 20 kHz). Affects only the delayed signal within the feedback loop, thinning repeats over time.
    * Visual representation (e.g., simple curve display).
* **Saturation/Character:**
    * Single knob control ("Warmth" or "Drive").
    * Adds subtle analog-style saturation/soft clipping to the delayed signal within the feedback loop, simulating tape or bucket-brigade characteristics.

**4.3 Modulation**

* **LFO (Low-Frequency Oscillator):**
    * **Source:** One primary LFO.
    * **Waveforms:** Sine, Triangle, Square, Saw Up, Saw Down, Random (Sample & Hold).
    * **Rate Control:**
        * Sync Mode: Synchronize LFO rate to host DAW tempo (similar subdivisions as Delay Time).
        * Free Mode: Set LFO rate in Hz (e.g., 0.01 Hz to 20 Hz).
    * **Depth/Amount Control:** Controls the intensity of the modulation.
    * **Destinations:** Ability to modulate:
        * Delay Time (Left/Right or Both) - Creates chorus, flanger, vibrato effects.
        * Filter Frequency (LPF/HPF) - Creates filter sweeps on repeats.
        * Pan (of delayed signal) - Creates auto-pan effects on repeats.
        * Amplitude (of delayed signal) - Creates tremolo effects on repeats.
    * Clear indication of modulation routing and depth.

**4.4 User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX)**

* **Layout:** Clean, intuitive, and logically organized controls.
* **Visual Feedback:**
    * Real-time input/output metering.
    * Visual representation of LFO activity (e.g., glowing indicator, moving waveform).
    * Visual indication of filter settings.
    * Optional: Visualization of delay taps/timing.
* **Resizable Interface:** User can resize the plugin window.
* **Preset Manager:**
    * Load and save presets.
    * Organize presets into categories (Factory, User).
    * Include a diverse set of factory presets showcasing different capabilities.
* **Parameter Control:**
    * Standard knobs and sliders.
    * Double-click to reset parameter to default.
    * Modifier key (e.g., Shift+Drag) for fine control.
    * Full automation support for all parameters in DAWs.
* **Utilities:**
    * A/B Comparison slots.
    * Undo/Redo functionality for parameter changes.
    * Clear tooltips explaining each control on mouse hover.
    * Global Input and Output Gain controls (+/- dB).

**4.5 Advanced Features (Optional / Stretch Goals)**

* **Ducking:** Automatically reduce the wet signal level when the dry input signal is present, improving clarity. Threshold and Release controls.
* **Freeze/Hold:** Button to capture the current delay buffer content and loop it indefinitely.
* **Diffusion/Smear:** Control to add reverb-like diffusion to the echoes, smoothing them out.
* **Reverse Delay:** Option to reverse the delayed audio segments.

**5. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Performance:**
    * Low CPU usage, suitable for use on multiple tracks within a session.
    * Minimal latency; report any introduced latency accurately to the host DAW.
* **Compatibility:**
    * **Operating Systems:** macOS (latest 3 versions, Apple Silicon & Intel), Windows (10, 11 - 64-bit).
    * **Plugin Formats:** VST2 (64-bit), VST3 (64-bit), AU (64-bit), AAX (64-bit).
    * **DAW Compatibility:** Tested and verified in major DAWs (Ableton Live, Logic Pro X, Pro Tools, Cubase, FL Studio, Studio One, Reaper).
* **Stability:** No crashes, memory leaks, or audio artifacts (clicks, pops, glitches - unless intended via saturation). Handles various buffer sizes and sample rates (44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz, 96kHz, potentially 192kHz).
* **Installation:** Simple, reliable installer for both macOS and Windows.
* **Licensing:** User-friendly copy protection mechanism (e.g., Serial Number activation, Online Activation - specifics TBD).

**6. Design Considerations**

* **Aesthetics:** Modern, clean visual design. Legible fonts, high contrast for readability. Potential Dark/Light mode toggle.
* **Accessibility:** Consider color-blind users in color choices. Ensure logical keyboard navigation (tabbing order).

**7. Release Criteria**

* All Core Features (Section 4.1 - 4.4) implemented and fully functional.

* Factory presets are included and well-organized.
* User Manual (PDF or online) is complete and accurate.
* Installer functions correctly on target OS.
* Licensing mechanism works as intended.

**8. Future Considerations (Post V1.0)**

* Additional modulation sources (e.g., Envelope Follower, Random Stepped Generators).
* More filter types (Band-Pass, Notch, Comb).
* Grain/Pitch shifting options within the delay line.
* Mid/Side processing capabilities.
* Integrated Reverb module.
* Advanced routing options.

**9. Open Issues**

* Final decision on specific saturation algorithm/flavor.
* Specifics of the licensing/copy protection system.
* Final graphical design mockups required.
